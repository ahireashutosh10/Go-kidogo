        We all met in a programming class. Of course we wanted to program fun games. After the first 2-3 meetings we talked about plastic and the "FRIDAYS-FOR-FUTURE" demos. We all agreed that it is also imperative that individuals reconsider their consumption patterns. This also includes the use of technologies and service offers.
        </p>
         <br/> 
         <br/> 
        <p>For many of our daily "conveniences" we could pay a very high price in the future.</p>
        <br/> 
        <br/>
       <p>The discussions were so moving and inspiring that our mentor suggested taking a small step towards a sustainable world together.</p>
       <br/> 
       <br/>
      <p>Through a scrum session and other product discussions, we came up with the idea of ​​coding a sustainable delivery portal. Go Kidogo is therefore a good example of the fact that we not only have to rethink technologies for even more convenience, but especially in the present time for a just and sustainable world.</p>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p>At Go Kidogo, we value the essentials: quality of the food, fairness towards our restaurant partners and sustainable packaging.</p>

          <p class="lead">The problem</p>
         
         <p>On average, one person produces 226.5 kilograms of packaging waste every year.
          <br/>
         The consumption of service packaging (out-of-home consumption) in the catering industry increased by 325 percent from 2000 to 2020. 
         <br/>
         According to a Statista forecast, a total of 17.1 million people will use online food delivery services this year. By 2023, the number is expected to rise to 21.6 million.</p>
        
        <p class="lead">Our approach</p>
         <p>We are sustainable and promote sustainability; Our restaurants deliver the food completely packaging-free.
          <br/>
         With our high-quality reusable packaging, we are declaring war on disposable packaging for take-away food. Go Kidogo stands for sustainable management and consumption. (Green Economy).
         <br/>
         With this approach we want to help to reduce the burden on the environment.
         <br/>
         Go Kidogo supports its partners to become more sustainable and to reduce packaging waste and save costs. In addition, Go Kidogo offers its partners a completely fair and transparent price model.</p>
         
         <p class="lead">Our approach</p>
         <p>
         With Go Kidogo, we have created an environmentally friendly and sustainable online delivery portal for ordering meals by using 
         <br/>
         a returnable deposit system for take-away meals.
         <br/>
         Our reusable containers are made from 100% QUALITY PLASTIC and are also 100% recyclable. In addition, they are absolutely free of 
         <br/>
         harmful substances.
         </p>
          
          <p class="lead">Our guiding principles</p>
         <p>according to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>
            
                  "Don't go hungry: According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), around 1.3 billion tons of food ends up in the trash every year. At the same time, 821.6 <br/>million people are starving – a scandal! We want to save food and thus fight hunger."
            </li>
            <li>
            Less inequality: We want to enable restaurateurs to participate in the digital economy at market-oriented and fair conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
            Sustainable consumption: With Go Kidogo, we want to encourage consumers to rethink their consumption. Conscious enjoyment and 
            <br/>
            conservation of resources is our motto.
            </li>
            <li>
            Climate action: Our planet needs help, that much is clear. With our company, we are trying to make the constantly growing industry of food <br/>delivery services more climate-neutral. The transfer of knowledge on the topic of climate protection is therefore an important part of our work.
            </li>
         </ul>
